C - Structures, typedef
This repository contains Structures and typedef in C. The C language contains the typedef keyword that allow users to provide alternative names for the primitive and user-defined (e.g struct) data types. This keyword adds a new name for some existing data type but does not create a new type.

This repository contains example programs for the C - Structures, typedef, as well as some test cases.
