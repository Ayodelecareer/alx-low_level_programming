This project contains exercises and examples on Bit Manipulation, which is a technique used in a variety of problems to get the solution in an optimized way. This technique is very effective from a Competitive Programming point of view. It is all about Bitwise Operators which directly works upon binary numbers or bits of numbers that help the implementation fast.

Below are sections of these project to be executed:
0- To Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1- To Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
10 - To Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
11 - To Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
100- To Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
101- To Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Endianness- To Write a function that checks the endianness.
