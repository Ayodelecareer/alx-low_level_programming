This Project contains examples on Linked Lists in C. A linked list is basically a data structure for storing a collection of Items. 

At the end of this project, you should
1. Understand how the linked lists is being used
2. Begin to focus on the right source of information, with little or no supervision.

Below is a brief descripton of each sections in this
0. Print list: write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.
1. List length: write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
2. Add node: write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.
3. Add node at the end: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.
4. Free list: write a function that frees a listint_t list.
5. Free: write a function that frees a listint_t list.
6. Pop: write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).
7. Get node at index: write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
8. Sum list: write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
9. Insert: write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
10. Delete at index: write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
11. Reverse list: write a function that reverses a listint_t linked list.
12. Print (safe version): write a function that prints a listint_t linked list.
13. Free (safe version): write a function that frees a listint_t list.
14. Find the loop: write a function that finds the loop in a linked list.
