This Project, demonstrates how to create, Open a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.


This Project, demonstrates how to create, Open a text file for both reading and writing. 
A file represents a sequence of bytes, regardless of it being a text file or a binary file. 
C programming language grants access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on  storage devices.

Below are examples to be executed in this project:

0. Tread lightly, she is near: write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
1. Under the snow: create a function that creates a file.
2. Speak gently, she can hear: write a function that appends text at the end of a file.
3. cp:  write a program that copies the content of a file to another file.
4. elf: write a program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
